                    <li> Blue corundum. Well, it's very pretty. </li>
                    <li> <span class="hank">It's encrusted with igneous biotite in a mica schist. Would you like some more detail Because I can give it to you. You keep acting like you give the first shit, and I’ll…</span> </li>
                    <li> Hank. </li>
                    <li> <span class="hank">Found in the Central Cordillera of Irian Jaya. Blue corundum.</span> </li>
                    <li> I'm just saying it's 2 in the morning. I'm just asking if maybe… </li>

                    <li> Go show the boys your new rock collection. We're going to get things organized.</li>
                    <li>Yeah, it'll be about 10 minutes. </li>
                    <li> You have a rock collection? </li>
                    <li> <span class="hank">It's a mineral collection. Uh, just a little something I… You guys want to see it? Want to see it? </span> </li>
                    <li> Sure. Let's go see it. </li>
                    <li> Oh, hey, let me. </li>
                    <li> <span class="hank">Hey, it's all right. I got it. Come on, guys, it's down the hall here. </span> </li>
                    <li> <span class="hank">Now that one there, that's Rhodonite, okay? It's manganese inosilicate.</span> </li>
                    <li> Cool. What… What makes it be all pink like that? </li>
                    <li> <span class="hank">Well, that's the manganese part, okay? It… It oxidizes, you know, like rust.</span> </li>
                    <li> Exactly. Manganese can have an oxidation state of between -3 and +7, which takes it through a range of colors… Purple, green, blue. But its most stable state is +2, which is usually pale pink. So… </li>
                    <li> <span class="hank">So Exactly. Whatever the hell he said. </span>
                    <br>
                    <span class="hank">Anyway, you, uh, you get the idea.</span> </li>
                    <li> Yeah, it's, uh, interesting. Interesting stuff, that. </li>
